# Insights into Customer Behavior:

## Recency:
- A significant number of your customers have made recent purchases, as indicated by the 25th percentile at 45 days. However, there is a long tail stretching to around 350 days, suggesting that some customers haven't purchased in a long time.

## Frequency:
- The majority of customers have made few transactions, with 50% of them having made three or fewer transactions. High-frequency customers are less common, which is typical in many businesses.

## Monetary Value:
- Most customers have a relatively low monetary value, with the 25th and 50th percentiles at approximately $10.81 and $26, respectively. This indicates that there are a number of low-spending customers in the dataset.

# Recommendations for Marketing Strategies:

## Loyal Customers (Low Recency, High Frequency, High Monetary Value):
- Offer loyalty programs, discounts, and exclusive previews of new products.
- Engage with personalized communication to make them feel valued and encourage referrals.

## New Customers (Low Recency, Low Frequency):
- Create welcome campaigns with introductory offers to encourage second purchases.
- Request feedback on their buying experience to improve service and product offerings.

## At-Risk Customers (High Recency, Low Frequency):
- Re-engage with win-back campaigns, special offers, and reminders of the brand's value proposition.
- Conduct surveys to understand why they have not purchased recently and address those areas.

## Lost Customers (High Recency, Low Frequency, Low Monetary Value):
- Analyze the data to understand why they might have churned.
- Test different reactivation strategies like offering a highly attractive promotion to see if they can be enticed back.

# Adjusting Thresholds:

## Recency Threshold:
- Set to the 50th percentile or slightly above (around 121 days), which allows you to differentiate between customers who have engaged recently versus those who are at risk of churning.

## Frequency Threshold:
- Given that the 75th percentile is at 6 transactions, a threshold around the 50th percentile (3 transactions) would segment customers into those who purchase occasionally versus regular customers.

## Monetary Threshold:
- The 75th percentile is at $83.08. Setting a threshold near this value (e.g., $85) allows you to distinguish between higher-value customers and those with lower monetary contributions.
